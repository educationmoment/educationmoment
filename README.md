I’m one of the core software developers for the **UIC Lunabotics Team**, building a fully autonomous lunar excavation robot.  
Our stack leverages:

-  **C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS**
-  **ROS 2 Humble** with SLAM, Nav2, and sensor fusion
-  **SparkCAN motor control** (Thanks to Grayson @ COD)
-  Real-time control interfaces and live telemetry monitoring
