<p align="left">Hey, I am a robotic software engineer currently working in ML/AI. I know Python, CPP, C, C# and assembly the best.</p>

<p>My website is <b>https://terminal.college/</b>, where I post sometimes.</p>

<p>I use ROS2 Humble, and basically everything indepth of that (NAV2, RS, Gazebo/IssacSIM), on Ubuntu 22.04.</p>



<p>My last major project was our UIC robot from May 2025, at NASA Lunabotaics, which won 1st in Robotic Construction, and 5th in the Caterpiller Autonomy Award.</p>

<p>My current project is our new robot at UIC, which is completely rebuilt, and redesigned. I am working with an Intel NUC running Ubuntu 22.04, on ROS Humble.</p>
